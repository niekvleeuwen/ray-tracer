# ray-tracer
Object-oriented ray tracer in C++ 

## TODO
* Destructors
* Copying entire objects is avoided as much as possible
* Every Class a .h and .cpp (No code in the .h!)
* Make a renderer class. In the renderer class, give the pixel x,y to the ray tracer class for futher processing and only return the vector
* command line parameter to filepath to read from
* Group headers for all the BasicObjects and for all the Materials and use a .cpp for every class
